## About

Docker host as Vagrant box created with [kitchen-docker](https://github.com/portertech/kitchen-docker) in mind. Provides a Docker host and Squid as caching proxy. It doesn't have anything [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci) specific per-se, but it provides a consistent development environment.

## Dependencies

 * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
 * [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
 * [ChefDK](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/)
 * [vagrant-berkshelf](https://github.com/berkshelf/vagrant-berkshelf)
 * [Docker](https://www.docker.com) client

The vagrant-berkshelf plugin may be easily installed with:

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf
```

## How to use

For starting the VM, simply issue a `vagrant up` command in the root directory of this project. By default, it uses 4 virtual cores and 8192 GB of RAM. You may either edit the supplied Vagrantfile or export VB_CPUS and / or VB_MEM environment variables with the desired values.

The VM itself uses a host-only network adapter with the IP address 192.168.99.100. This makes it sort of a drop-in replacement for docker-machine. The Docker socket isn't TLS enabled though.

To tell the Docker client where to find the host, simply:

```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.99.100:2375
```

To check that the Docker connection is OK:

```bash
docker info

```

To use it with Test Kitchen, you need to install the kitchen-docker gem and to specify docker as Kitchen driver.

To use the Squid caching proxy you need to tell Test Kitchen to use http_proxy.

```yml
driver:
  name: docker
  http_proxy: http://192.168.99.100:3128

provisioner:
  chef_omnibus_url: http://www.chef.io/chef/install.sh
  client_rb:
    http_proxy: http://192.168.99.100:3128
```

The only thing that doesn't seem to belong here is chef_omnibus_url. However, the Omnibus installer defaults to HTTPS, unless the URL to install.sh uses HTTP. This allows Squid to cache the Chef package which is quite large at ~40 MB.

The whole configuration may be bit smater as in [this example](https://gist.github.com/fnichol/7551540).

## Speed up the Kitchen file transfer

By default, Test Kitchen with the kitchen-docker driver, uses SCP as transport backend. SCP is painfully slow for most of the tasks regarding file transfer to a Kitchen container. This cancels any speed gains from using containers instead of virtual machines provisioned by Vagrant. The rsync transport saves the day.

```bash
gem install kitchen-transport-rsync # or add it to your Gemfile
```

You need to install rsync inside the Kitchen container. These .kitchen.yml bits show you how to do it for Red Hat and Debian based distributions without a custom Dockerfile:

```yml
driver:
  name: docker
  provision_command:
  - if [ -x /usr/bin/yum ]; then yum -y install rsync; fi; if [ -x /usr/bin/apt-get ]; then apt-get -y install rsync; fi

transport:
  name: rsync
```

While provision_command accepts an array, doing a one liner gets the job done in one stage instead of two, which makes the Kitchen provisioning to be bit faster. Also, the commands themselves need to be wrapped in if statements as a non-zero exit stops the provisioning (equivalent to a script running with set -e).

kitchen-transport-rsync works with Test Kitchen 1.4.2, probably 1.4.x.

## Better usage of Docker caching

Docker itself saves each stage (layer) which is built from the Dockerfile which is generated by kitchen-docker. Unfortunately, there's a major cache buster which is the SSH key pair. A simple solution is to use public_key and private_key configuration options for the docker driver. By using static keys, the generated Dockerfile has identical layers which roughly translates in a provisioning that takes little over one second instead of more than twenty seconds. The Docker image commits are fairly cheap, but they don't come for free.

Example:

```yml
driver:
  name: docker
  public_key: ../kitchen_id_rsa.pub
  private_key: ../kitchen_id_rsa
```

If the provisioning fails, it means that you're using a kitchen-docker version that [isn't patched to strip the whitespace](https://github.com/portertech/kitchen-docker/pull/167) from the public_key. You'll need to remove the newline at the end of the key.

Caching the Chef Omnibus installation also brings performance improvements as it removes one more redundant step.

Example:

```yml
driver:
  name: docker
  provision_command:
    - curl -L http://www.getchef.com/chef/install.sh -o /tmp/install.sh && bash /tmp/install.sh -v 12.4.3

provisioner:
  name: chef_zero
  require_chef_omnibus: true # just checks the presence of a Chef Omnibus installation instead of passing a Chef version
```
